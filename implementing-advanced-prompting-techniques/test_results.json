The power rule states that the derivative of x^n, where n is any real number, is n*x^(n-1).\\n\\n3) Here's a step-by-step approach:\\n   a) Identify the power of x in each term of the function.\\n   b) Apply the power rule to each term to find the derivative.\\n\\n4) Let's execute each step:\\n   a) The powers of x in the terms of the function are 2, 1, and 0 respectively.\\n   b) Applying the power rule to each term:\\n      - The derivative of 3x\u00b2 is 2*3*x^(2-1) = 6x.\\n      - The derivative of 2x is 1*2*x^(1-1) = 2.\\n      - The derivative of -5 (a constant) is 0, because the derivative of a constant is always 0.\\n\\n5) So, the derivative of f(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 2x - 5 is f'(x) = 6x + 2. You can verify this by differentiating the original function term by term and seeing that you get the same result.\"}",
